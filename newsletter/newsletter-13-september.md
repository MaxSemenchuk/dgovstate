## 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 Dgov Network Updates

### Community highlights

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2840%29.png)

We've build the dgov network map with [graph commons](https://graphcommons.com/) tool. [Follow the link](https://graphcommons.com/graphs/6a993e34-d8b0-4425-83ce-67c3560429e7?auto=true&svg=true) reorder and click play to see how it moves dynamically – looks super cool! It's still work in progress. If you need something changed or added \(like yourself or your organization\) – please [create an issue](https://github.com/distributed-governance/map/issues) or ping Max \(e.g. here in the reply\).

Creating of this map led to the discussion of the  Self Sovereign ID for dgov network \(ideas like matchmaking, reputation etc\). [Join the conversation here](https://forum.dgov.foundation/t/self-sovereign-id-for-the-dgov-network/82).

### Web3 dgov node

Berlin Blockchain week was full of great events. We had DAOfest, Governance Games and of course the \#dgov node at web3 summit. If you have missed it – we've captured all videos from the lightning talks and notes from the panels. Here're my top3 picks:

* [Ecosystem Funding DAOs](https://forum.dgov.foundation/t/transcript-panel-ecosystem-funding-daos-dgov-node-at-web3-2019/79)

## ⚖️ Cryptolaw updates

This month has been all about legal entities for DAOs! The news about DOrg LLC DAO is still echoing strong and many have been thinking whether coming together virtually, pooling the funds and managing them in a coherent, democratical way through votes is worth the risk. Without a legal entity, all DAO members enter into a “general partnership” which puts everyone at risk all stakeholders, DAO members can be liable for debts or legal actions that a DAO may undergo. This is why through history we have created legal instruments and entities with a limited liability. Yet, the important part is the configuration of a legal entity and the process one needs to go through in order to bring more clarity and certainty regarding the risks members are taking. 

Many have written about and we highly recommend articles published by the [OpenLaw](https://medium.com/@OpenLawOfficial/the-era-of-legally-compliant-daos-491edf88fed0). 

We also addressed the legal perspectives and challenges of a DAO on our DGov Node at the Web3 Summit. Check out our outcomes:

We were also lucky to hear some thoughts Stephen Palley and Vlad Zamfir shared on a panel regarding Szabo’s Law and Vlad’s perception of the emerging crypto law. While Palley made a solid statement smart contracts automate the performance components of a contract, he does not support the idea of a consensus protocol as an agreement. We witnessed quite a debate about the governance, which is supposedly required with human interaction and debatably not with the code. 

Another thing Blockchain Week brought to us is the new programming language for lawyers, [Lexon](http://lexon.tech/). It holds the potential to integrate smart contracts with agreements lawyers are used to read and make the programming languages much more pleasant for a lawyer’s eye. Not only are we excited for this phenomenal user experience but also the possibility to digitalize long pages of text and make the performance component much fluid, transparent and automated.
