# Newsletter \#10 \(june\)

Hi my dear org hackers, Max here.

June was pretty hot in all aspects – check out all the updates we've prepared for you to.

## Network development

### Stats

We're maintaining and expanding the [ecosystem map by type](https://wiki.dgov.foundation/foundation/strategy/stakeholders) and [by geography](https://wiki.dgov.foundation/map-of-the-industry-landscape). Overall there're 400+ members in the community,  300+ subscribers to this newsletter and 200+ in the telegram chat. Only people working in dgov implementation, research etc. If you need to use those channels to transmit the information – get in touch.

### Web3 dgov node

It's happening, we'll have 3 days with different focus \(law & philosophy, market & incentives, soft governance\). Check out [an early draft of the agenda](https://forum.dgov.foundation/t/web-3-summit-dgov-node/63). If you'd like to contribute to the program \(talk, topic, speaker recommendation\) – get in touch with me email: max.semenchuk@gmail.com , telegram: @maxsemenchuk.

### Meetups

First Caribbean meetup \(in Trinidad and Tobago\) happened on Jun 7. It included lightning talk and workshops [find more info here](https://medium.com/@A.Blaj/trinidao-grassroots-3c46d9137e35). Thanks to Anja Blaj, Luuk Weber and Ruben Russel for the organization!

### OrgTech Review **Highlights**

[Dynamic Governance: Where Cybernetics Meets Sociology](https://github.com/alberreman/Distributed-Collaborative-Entity/blob/master/Dynamic%20Governance%20-%20Where%20Cybernetics%20Meets%20Sociology.md). Dynamic governance, or sociocracy, is a management approach where decisions are made with consent where nobody objects, as opposed to consensus where everybody agrees. Teams \('circles'\) are interlinked through individuals who belong to two or more circles across all hierarchical levels. As a consequence, dynamic governance can help organisations to move forward with decisions quickly while also make use of knowledge throughout the organisation.

[Introducing Glider](https://blog.colony.io/introducing-glider/). Colony's mainnet release candidate \(Glider\) has been deployed to the Görli Ethereum testnet. This release won't have the full whitepaper functionality; you'll be able to create a new colony, create your colony's internal token \(or import any ERC-20 token\), manage tasks and payments within single-level domains, assign permissions on a role basis, and more. Colony's reputation system can be used to proportionally distribute rewards, but will not influence permissions at this stage.

[Aragon, DAOstack, Colony, Moloch](http://kronosapiens.github.io/blog/2019/06/16/aragon-daostack-colony-moloch.html). A comparison. Aragon provides a modular backbone that supports any decision-making mechanism, which may make it easier for them to build out a developer ecosystem. DAOstack explicitly prioritises decentralised decision-making at scale, targeting the problem of attention with their "holographic consensus" model \(linked above\). Colony's focus is designing mechanisms that don't rely on voting, overcoming inertia with time-driven reputation mechanics that help workers "get shit done". Moloch is a "minimum viable process" for resource allocation, which prioritises minority protection with a novel "rage quit" mechanism.

[DAO Memorandum of Understanding](https://github.com/dOrgTech/LL-DAO/blob/master/templates/dOrg-OpenESQ-SMOU-Executed.md?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app). [dOrg LLC](https://www.gravelshea.com/2019/06/dorg-launches-first-limited-liability-dao/) and Open, [Esq LLC, an Aragon LLC-DAO](https://twitter.com/r_ross_campbell/status/1089952571295494151), formed the first memorandum of understanding between two limited liability DAOs, to collaborate on LLC-DAO pilots and develop a tool that will enable other DAOs to establish their legal identity.

[The Era of Legally Compliant DAOs](https://medium.com/@OpenLawOfficial/the-era-of-legally-compliant-daos-491edf88fed0). OpenLaw has built upon the earlier work of Open ESQ and dOrg, with the launch of the [OpenLaw DAO](https://dao.openlaw.io/), a free legal repository for people to easily deploy Limited Liability Wrappers for their DAOs. These wrappers will prevent DAOs from being defined by default as general partnerships, which would result in joint and several liability for all members. This dramatically expands the use cases of DAOs, empowering them to take on more traditional contractual relationships and manage physical assets.

* As there was some [proposals](http://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1143228564826779648) to merge Ethereum and  Libra and making Ethereum a validator, we cannot go around regulators’ [response](https://www.ft.com/content/5535fb3a-91ea-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2) the this new crypto consortium. What are your thoughts? 

As mentioned above, Web3 is happening at the end of August and we’ll be hosting a DGOV Node there as well!
