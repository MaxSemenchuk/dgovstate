# Newsletter \#12 \(august\)

Bonjorno, dear Org Hackers, Max here.

This is the \#12 issue of our newsletter, meaning that a year passed since we started to do this newsletter. We're putting a lot of effort to serve the community, please let us know how it works so far – [**fill in the dgov survey**](https://forms.gle/x8XhucK2mC1PQF8M9) ****😍 🙄 🥵. It takes only 3-5 mins but would be a super valuable info for us

Thanks in advance. And let's get to the updates.

## 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 Dgov Network Updates

### Community highlights

We've build the dgov network map with [graph commons](https://graphcommons.com/) tool. [Follow the link](https://graphcommons.com/graphs/6a993e34-d8b0-4425-83ce-67c3560429e7?auto=true&svg=true) reorder and click play to see how it moves dynamically – looks super cool! It's still work in progress. If you need something changed or added \(like yourself or your organization\) – please [create an issue](https://github.com/distributed-governance/map/issues) or ping Max \(e.g. here in the reply\).

Creating of this map led to the discussion of the  Self Sovereign ID for dgov network \(ideas like matchmaking, reputation etc\). [Join the conversation here](https://forum.dgov.foundation/t/self-sovereign-id-for-the-dgov-network/82).
