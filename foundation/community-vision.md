**What can be improved?**

Tim: interpersonal relationships, deep connections

Aeon: not doing specific goals tension is big, stops the flow & motivation, specifically network

Phoebe: Regularity, monthly meetup in Berlin. Depth is great too, but regularity is most. More articles, content.

Anja: whenever we have events, see when we're there and do satellite events. Opportunity to argue in person.

**How do I know community is good for you?**

Tim: shared culture and rituals, which frequency we come togethers, purpose and interest. Strongly interconnected.

Aeon: clearly defined purpose why are we the community

Martin: shared interest, possibility to act on this interest together \(purpose can be different\). Forum to come from

Phoebe: strong shared identity \(who we invite, who not\). Longevity, shared commitment. Trust – what people do for each other.

Anja: balanced community, longevity, interesest, frequency. Not good community if no balance. Everybody is capable of contributing in a balanced life. Not one overweights the others. Harmony.

**What is our shared identity? \(Ethereum Magicians\)**

Aeon: System hackers \(6\) – phase shift for the systems, next era

Martin: transmogrifiers \(0, World changers\) – something new and better, surptising and unexepected

Phoebe: burning man sect of blockchain \(but without money\) 0, blockchain hippies \(0\). Place of deep connection, soft governance and values. Refiners. Funky, fun, punks, rebels \(3\)

Anja: cyberpunk \(6\) / cypherpunk \(0\) /rebellions, against the system, interdisciplinary, do a education. Playful attitude. Rational reimbursement for hard moments.

Tim: White rabbits \(2-3\), carrers \(4\), connectors networkers \(4\), connecting the worlds. Not perceived the problem solvers. How we make certain values.

Max: org rephormators \(6\)
