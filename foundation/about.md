Is decentralization always the answer? When is decentralization \*not\* the most appropriate system to use in organising? What are the questions necessary to ask in making those decisions? I am interested in the deep social protocols and legal structures necessary to actualise decentralised/distributed organising and governance of assets in the real world. Debunking DGOV hype.
