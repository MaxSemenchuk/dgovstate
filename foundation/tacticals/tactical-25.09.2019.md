## Contributors

* Internal governance clear plan, goals, roles, value exchange \(Phoebe\) – don't have energy now, huge list of tasks, can't do a lot in the next few weeks, lack of energy around dgov overall. Maybe a loop with not take care on the team. Can work on the handbook with Max.

### Phoebe / Who's the contributor?

Maybe we lack agreed language, e.g. retreat, work sprint, contributors etc...

What do we call our 6 members?

What do we call people who support the work?

How do we call the people who're mo passive?

How should we do that?

Max: i'm for somebody to decide and just consult

Phoebe: let's put to the wiki

Action points: handbook, wiki, twitter...

### Phoebe / Summary what's going now active in dgov

Anja: council, not sure about the retreat. Weekly calls, newsletter, twitter, telegram active. Have ambassadors. Have communication channels. Event being prepared. +EU funding.

Max: 

* Newsletter \(83%\)
* \#dgov tag & twitter \(58%\)
* Network map \(54%\)
* Meetups \(50%\)
* Council \(46%\)
* Forum \(46%\)

## Network

* Knowledge production support \(Max\) – i've created ~12 working groups. Over time will add people and info, maybe setup calls on those groups. Will go to the council
* Leaders / Collaboration and communication support \(Ela\) – figuring out what to do here
* External awareness & integration \(Anja\) – haven't got the the strategy, but will start with a timeline – what we do monthly. Just to make an overview. E.g. every wed a material. The rest of the community – need to think about it. For the external people, e.g. political scientists – would like to make it in the CRM form. There's a big list of political scientist and somebody needs to go through the list.

### Phoebe / Anja clarification

Pls summarize in a sentence: how we treat the external audience / present ourselves to the outer world. How we communication what we are about \(how often etc\).

Stick to traditional language +

### Luuk / Roles and responsibilities

What are the main roles and responsibilities for the core team? Projects or just connecting?

Max showed the [Strategy](../strategy.md) and [Governance](../governance.md)

Phoebe: question of roles is lively. More people, making sense of it.

Anja: have a lot of people who want to help.

Luuk: We can open up – who want's to help and with what.

Anja: it's more about how we form the working groups. e.g. With regulation. We have people interested in different tasks. E.g. in the newsletter we address 3 topics. So we can form the groups and send them stuff only on this topic.

Phoebe: dgov was a top priority, but we lack resources. Was unsustainable. Not everything needs to be paid, but need to cover the bills. We need resources. Even if it's $400/week. Do be able to give upo the paid work.

Luuk: \(have no legal structure\)

Anja: discussed that with Ela. Can use partners companies.

Phoebe: old tension - can bring on the next meeting.
