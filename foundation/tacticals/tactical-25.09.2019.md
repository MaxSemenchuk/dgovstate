### Phoebe / Who's the contributor?

Maybe we lack agreed language, e.g. retreat, work sprint, contributors etc...

What do we call our 6 members?

What do we call people who support the work?

How do we call the people who're mo passive?

How should we do that?

Max: i'm for somebody to decide and just consult

Phoebe: let's put to the wiki

Action points: handbook, wiki, twitter...

* External awareness & integration \(Anja\) – haven't got the the strategy, but will start with a timeline – what we do monthly. Just to make an overview. E.g. every wed a material. The rest of the community – need to think about it. For the external people, e.g. political scientists – would like to make it in the CRM form. There's a big list of political scientist and somebody needs to go through the list.
