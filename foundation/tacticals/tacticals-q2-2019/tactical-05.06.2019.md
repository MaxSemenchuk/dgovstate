## Tensions

### Max / Format of updates

Let's do updates without feedback.

### Max / Web 3 deadlines

Tim, Max, Phoebe to create the 80% ready agenda by Jul 1

### Phoebe / Fitting soft governance into web 3 \(d1-d2\)

There're would be be fewer people. Should we rethink the agenda to give enough space to the soft governance. Maybe across days. E.g. morning philosophy.

**Should the SG be left to day 3?**

Max: it overlapps dappcon, dappcon is highly engineering event,  audience may be not too ovelapping

Martin: maybe now have blocks, but mix topics. How much space do we have in general. if there's no room – i'll have a tension

It shouldn't block inviting the people.

### Martin / DAO Crash Test Discussion

**What are the thoughts about increasing the attendance?**

Max: we have a 12 mentors in the DAO inc, but only small part participates 2-3 people. People lack interest/incentive from that. Maybe it's not clear how participating will help mentors in the first place.

Phoebe: expanding to the dgov crash test? Come with horizontal workshop? Expand inclusion. Can come with seeds DAO.

Martin:

* Collecting feedback? yes,
* Strict format? CE Ritual Dissent
* Maybe half workshop/half presentation?

**Is the purpose clear and people know what to expect? Tweak for better understanding?**

Max: in DB we have maybe 20-30 people who are in early stage of DAO. % can attend on the date, % has motivation to do that. Expand the audience maybe. People think it's an offline workshop. Better marketing/communication will help.

Phoebe: try to invite the expert for incentive. Feel a bit vulnerable. Would like to help and iterate. Like project kitchen.

### Phoebe / Meetup in London

Give the same presentation, presenting dgov – vision, strategy, lightning talks + coffee/lightning discussion. Have a free venue \(epic!\).

**Feedback round:**

* How much time needed? \(15 will show up\)
* What connections we have in London?

Martin: if agree the date – would love to come earlier. \(21-22\) Open-coop, hackspace. Some platforms have geo tag – maybe even some aragon people are there.

Max: sharing and event creation 2-3 hours, no big preparations neededs. Jack L, Furtherfield, Open Platform Coops, Colony, Phoebe, Newspeakhouse.

**2 weeks enough?**

Max: having it connected to some bigger event is a good idea. Smaller audience at start isn't harming, but supports deep relationships.

Martin: let's fix the date with who's most probable there. And go from there. Question – before or after coop. Can take some organization from Phoebe!

Phoebe: night before coops we do a BBQ with the aligned crowd – we may do that just before that \(on 26th\).
