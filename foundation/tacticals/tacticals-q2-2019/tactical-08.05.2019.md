        <p>We need an agreement on purpose (deep or wide). Please tell why we want
          to spend time together:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Phoebe: success = very high momentum, have collective ways, avoid pointless
            rabbit holes, practices with bells to bring us back to present and big
            picture. Have some time to reconnect and say our intentions. Check-in in
            person, dinner/meal, why are we doing this. Shared vision and purpose.</li>
          <li>Anja: same, a lot needs to be done, a question about 150 people, understand
            how we do different tasks, what is the strategy</li>
          <li>Max: clear action plan. Doesn&#x2019;t feel like a typical organisation,
            everyone pursues his/her ideals, but then I want to understand where we
            can support each other&#x2029;Have time to share ideas we have and better
            understand why each of us want to do different things&#x2029;. See how
            we want to collaborate and go from there.&#x2029;</li>
          <li>Tim: Refresh on the vision, if we want to be more involved &#x2013; get
            funding. Have a proposal for the action plan. Need alignment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See the reiteration of the purpose (start with why). Overview &#x2013;
          what&apos;s in our portfolio. What we can achieve by being part of the
          system. ~Personalities and profiles. What they like dealing with and what
          they don&#x2019;t like dealing with. Better understand why people react
          and trigger in different ways. Please give feedback on a rough schedule(ish)
          of the areas you listed&#x2028;:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Purpose (of our work)</li>
          <li>Principles (of how we work together)&#x2028;</li>
          <li>Practices (or Protocols?)&#x2028;</li>
          <li>Personalities (diversity, yay!)&#x2028;</li>
          <li>Partners (...)&#x2028;</li>
          <li>Portfolio-Planning (what&apos;s next, what&apos;s important)</li>
          <li>Party ;-)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Comfortable with it?</p>
        <p>Tim: don&apos;t work on the 1st day. Yeap. Have a biz model I want to
          introduce. We can communicate to Martin instead of a clear timeline.</p>
        <p>Phoebe: Personalities come before (Tim: support). Would like to set deliverables
          for each point (e.g. motives, way of work, trigger for each person). Add
          a Business model (value-in, value-out). Schedule downtime.</p>
        <p>Anja: adding Funding as a part of our schedule</p>
        <p>Max: +goals till the end of the year</p>
        <p>Martin: if you see the exercise to address the point &#x2013; let me know.</p>
