## Project Updates

Purpose: Develop a Vibrant Network

* Work until 4:00 pm CET
* Community
  * Facilitate group communication \(chat, forum, newsletter etc\) by **Max** – all is growing, web3 gives some momentum, big thanks to Anja
  * Create information flows \(wiki, map\) by **Max** – played with this network tool, it's not full, but also shows the core of the network/community, which is ~60 people, 40 organizations.
  * Establish processes within the network \(meetups, media\) by **Ela** – no update
* Co-Create Events
  * Web3 dgov track  by **Max** – 90% done, few free tickets delayed, working on it.
  * Retreat in Ljubljana by **Anja** – stucked, proposed to cancel, Ela put the document with all info, put a tension about emails/thoughts
  * Meetup at Devcon by **Max** – no updates, spoke with Lane, no seems no help needed
* Launch dgov experiments
  * Funding with Seed DAO by **Tim** – had a call with Tim & Phoebe – was pretty good, but no follow up. Also at web3 will have a DAOincubator workshop about informing about Seed DAO and also talk about things we want to co-create. How might we get Tim on the same page on the outcomes of the workshop.
