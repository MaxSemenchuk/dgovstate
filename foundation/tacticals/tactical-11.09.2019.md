### Ela / Retreat how to proceed

Haven't agreed on [the cancellation letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HrPMz53Ef0x4PwhbFMCysYVeZN1uAEOh3U3vFI9VNy8/edit) – pls comment. Would be nice to have something feasible.

\(Max: I trust you\)

### Anja / Retreat

Need to schedule the call with Ori and Orzan and include that in the letter.

Tim: can you ask Ori, & i'll ask Orzan until the end if the week. Like your plan.

### Max / Next Council

Overall, when, where

* Anja: virtual summit on 20th of Jan – set date. If we know dates of Aragon – good idea. In the middle of nowhere is brave. Before or after Aracon is great. There's also a place in UK \(Ambercom\).
* Tim: share the perspective, but also we're big enough. Have traction. If we find the host for  free - that can be the determining partner. Don't want to be in the shadow. Should be neutral. For small events nice to have it connected. But next council can be a standalone. Shouldn't go with the paid location. Will priotitize our meeting as soon as possible.
* Aeon: nothing to add
* Max: Full node, other major players DAO stack, maybe EU grant, web3... if association would be broad, still like people to not travel twice. Berlin is THE CITY.

Next steps: Max will ask Aragon about their plan/dates. Prepare the council concept paper \(why and what outcomes we want to have\).

## Closing thought

* Anja: good meeting, like 2 hours and discussions about new events
* Aeon: love it, all's cool, commitments are clear, feel motivated
* Max: super great meeting, moving in the right direction
* Tim: great meeting. Thankful that we could resolve inner tensions
